#### info
- mostly sane hotkeys ie SUPER+F to open firefox, SUPER+V for n(v)im, SUPER+N for nnn
- **super simple** to make modifying, understanding much easier than most highly scripted ones I've seen
- waybar might need some tlc as the bubbles are designed to not expand, but if your screen/font changes you might need to make the bubbles bigger, or live with them expanding
- mostly done from scratch but some reference/inspiration or parts taken from:
  - https://github.com/flick0/dotfiles
  - https://github.com/archcraft-os/archcraft-hyprland
